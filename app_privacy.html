Privacy Policy for WoofSense

Effective Date: 22.06.2025

1. Introduction
1.1 We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our application users. This Privacy Policy explains how WoofSense collects, uses, and protects your personal information.
1.2 By using the WoofSense mobile application, you agree to the collection and use of your information in accordance with this policy.

2. Data We Collect
We may collect, store, and use the following kinds of personal information:
(a) Device and usage data: including IP address, device type, OS, language settings, and in-app behavior patterns.
(b) Login data: if you sign in using Google, Apple, or Facebook, we collect only the data shared through these services (typically your name and email address). This is the only method of registration.
(c) Profile data: you may optionally provide your name (or alias), and your dog's name to personalize your experience. This data is not verified and may be anonymous.
(d) Audio and media access: WoofSense allows you to either record your dog’s bark using the microphone or upload existing audio/video files from your device to analyze barking patterns. These recordings are used for emotional analysis and are not stored unless you give explicit permission.
(e) Communication data: metadata and content from messages or feedback you send to us.
(f) Analytics data: using third-party services like Firebase or Amplitude to collect anonymous usage statistics.

3. How We Use Your Information
We use your personal data to:
- Operate and maintain the app functionality.
- Analyze dog barks using AI and deliver emotional feedback.
- Improve the app and personalize your experience.
- Respond to inquiries and feedback.
- Provide customer support.
We do not sell your personal data or audio to third parties.

4. Audio, Media, and Microphone Permissions
WoofSense uses your microphone when you choose to record a bark and also requests access to your device's media library to allow you to upload existing audio or video files. These files are processed temporarily for emotional analysis. We do not store recordings unless you explicitly allow us to do so (e.g. for training or feedback purposes).

5. Children’s Privacy
This app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used the app, contact us to delete their data.

6. Data Retention
We retain personal information only as long as necessary to provide our services or as required by law. You may request deletion of your data via the in-app account deletion option or by contacting us by email.

7. Data Security
We use industry-standard security measures, including encryption in transit, secure servers, and limited access protocols. However, no system is 100% secure.

8. Your Rights
Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the following rights regarding your personal data:
- Right of Access
- Right to Rectification
- Right to Erasure
- Right to Restriction of Processing
- Right to Data Portability
- Right to Object
- Right to Withdraw Consent

To exercise any of these rights, contact us at: privacy@woofsense.app

9. Third-Party Services
We may use third-party SDKs and services for analytics and performance monitoring (e.g. Firebase, Google Analytics). These services may collect anonymized data.
We do not use third-party advertising networks.

10. International Data Transfers
Data may be transferred to and stored on servers outside your country. We ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for such transfers, in accordance with applicable laws.

11. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Material changes will be notified via the app or email.

Disclaimer: WoofSense is based on ongoing research in canine behavior and sound analysis. While it is not a certified veterinary or clinical diagnostic tool, it leverages scientific methodologies and AI models trained on real-world data to interpret barking patterns. The app is intended to provide educational and illustrative feedback, and results should not be used as a substitute for professional veterinary or behavioral advice.
